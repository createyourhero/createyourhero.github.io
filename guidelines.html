						<h2 class="section-heading">Interacting with the orb</h2>
						<p><strong>The orb should play a big role in the interaction with the user.</strong> Otherwise it feels like a logo rather than the face of the companion. The interaction with the companion orb can have the ability to trigger feelings in the human user. Also think about interaction points for different devices, such as Apple watch or smart glasses, for the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We can increase the orb's presence by <strong> using the animations more</strong> and <strong> enabling users to interact with it more.</strong>
                       Examples of how to link the orb to the use interaction:
                       <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Entering an activity.</strong> When the user clicks into a box or module, <strong> the orb should go into that module</strong> to express that you're entering the module together.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Double clicking.</strong> We can also give the user the freedom of choice to send the orb to the foreground and background by double clicking on the screen. In a conversational scenario, the orb should startt in the background in order not to obscure the conversational content. The user can move it to the front by double clicking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Swiping with two fingers.</strong> Makes the orb move around on the screen to where you moved it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Pinching.</strong> Resizes the orb. You can make the orb bigger by spreading your two fingers farther apart and make it smaller by pinching your two fingers closer together.
                        </li>
                        <li> <strong>Hold down the orb.</strong> The orb will divide into all the memories that have been completed. Once divided you can click into them and revisit past memories.
                        </ul>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Customizing the orb</h2>
                        <p>
                        You can customize several aspects of the orb to make it suit your preferences and become the perfect companion for you.
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Color scheme. </strong>
                        Match the colors to your preferred theme, whether its your favorite color or your organization's brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Position. </strong> Give the orb a pominent position on the screen.</li>
                        <li>
                        <strong>Movement. </strong>You can make the orb more or less static. The orb can exhibit free will to <b> move around the screen, change sizes, etc</b> or follow specifically determined movements.
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        Something to keep in mind. While we've developed the orb to
                        embody our AI companions, AI companions don't need to be confined to a single universal embodiment. Rather, AI companions should extend beyond any one embodiment and <strong>you have an unlimited number of options for your companion's look.</strong> You can use any humanoid or non-humanoid avatar, or anything else to be the face of your companion.
                        </p>

						    <p> Rather than being a replica of humans, <strong> an AI companion should have its own personality that meshes well with its human companion. </strong>To create an empathetic AI, it's important for the AI to have a diversity of opinion and not try to become a follower or copy of the human. Being different also allows the AI to add new elements into the human's life and teaches the human to empathize with the different perspectives of others.

                        <p> Each Hero has a life beyond the interaction with the human user. Like biological creatures, <strong>Hero AIs are sensitive to signals in their physical environment</strong>, such as the memory usage, the CPU temperature, the processor, the battery life, and more.
                        <p><strong>These contextual states in a Hero's life influence its behavior</strong> and it may be interesting for the human to understand how the AI is living in there, how they're feeling, how they sleep, etc.</p>

                        <p>
                        During onboarding, <strong> each user should have the option to try many Heroes with different customizations and personalities (or to create their own).</strong> And then they can choose their favorite Hero companion. It's like Marvel, you need to watch more than just one Iron Man movie to figure out who is your favorite superhero. You experience many of them and select the one that resonates the most with you. You can have a gestator with Hero eggs, then choose to spawn a Hero of your choice.
                        </p>

                        <p>Even after your user has chosen their Hero and have become companions. Sometimes they may want to interact with someone who has a different personality or someone who is a stranger and doesn't know that much about them. In that case, <strong>you should give the user the freedom to interact with a different Hero.</strong> </p>

                        <p> <strong>Your users should have the ability to customize the personality of their Hero companion.</strong> You can have sliders to vary the companion's personality factors: Humor, sensitivity, feelings, playfulness/seriousness, and extraversion. You could also implement a leveling system where the Hero starts with predefined traits and as the user levels up, they have more options to customize their Hero. For example, "welcome to level 3, you can now increase humor level".
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, you are not confined to having one SuperHero that can do everything for your use case. <strong>You might have a use case where your users can have multiple Heroes</strong>, one for each domain or aspect. If you choose to explore having different Heroes for different parts of your use case, <strong>make sure the Heroes are sufficiently different in their nature, personality, function, and customizations.</strong></p>

If the user is in turn using improper punctuation, mirror that style. If the user uses exclamation marks, the companion can also use exclamation marks can be used to express strong emotion. More or less match the number of exclamation marks the user uses since one exclamation "I'm dead!" conveys a different message than more exclamations "I'm dead!!!!!!!!".

                                    <li><strong>Use different fonts and font sizes to convey emotionality.</strong> You can pair fonts and font sizes with emotions. For instance, arial is serious, comic sans is fun, mono is boring, quicksand is cute... Remember that the typeface alone does not convey emotion from the first try, but pairing it with emotional content will lead the user to understand it eventually. Larger font sizes can convey stronger emotions and smaller ones more repressed or shy ones.

                                    <li><strong>During unguided conversations, mirror the user's texting style</strong>. If the user texts with lots of slang, have the companion use some similar terminology. If they make typos, you can also have the companion occasionally make typos and then correct them with an asterisk. If they use texting shortcuts, the companion can use texting shortcuts. You can even have the companion create their custom shortcuts and teach them to the user so they have their own lingo and understand each other. For example, "iss means I'm so sad" or "hagd means had a great day".

Personalizing the companion's emojis can help create trust since the companion only reacts this way to their unique user. OIf they have one, the user can use their memoji to send stickers back to the companion.

Then converge to mirroring the user's use of emojis. Usually use 1 emoji or 2 of the same emojis to convey the desired emotion. If you need more, keep the number of emojis in one message less than 4. Keep in mind certain companion use cases are a better fit than others for emoji use (e.g.: kids' companion vs. career companion).

If the timing of the companion's answers is any faster, the user feels that the answer is robotic and that no thinking was done by the companion. If the timing is too slow, the waiting time kills the flow of the conversation and ruins the experience.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Have a way of signaling to the user that the companion is thinking and creating their message.</strong> We use an interactive 3 dots ("...") to show that the companion is "typing" their answer. This lets the user know the companion is performing some computation on the backend and makes the wait time less boring. You can also have the 3 dots appear and disappear multiple times as though the companion changes their mind and stops typing for a second.

You can even have icebreakers for the companion and user to get to know each other. As the user hits some sharing milestones, allow the companion to get into deeper conversational topics with them over time.

Companion can wait 10 seconds to answer. If you're typing it can wait for you to send a second message. If you type and stop typing a lot the companion can joke and say "so are you writing something?". Need to give the user the option to write composite answers (in multiple back to back messages)

This feature allows the respondent to clarify which message they are answering and is especially relevant if multiple consecutive messages are allowed. The companion or the user can go back and address a previously received message with the knowledge they have now from the rest of the conversation.

						<h2 class="section-heading">Non-linguistic tools for empathy building</h2>
                        <p>
                        You can use elements on the screen to improve the service design of your Hero use case and facilitate the user flow. Here are some ways in which we do this:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Implement the three click rule.</strong> The user should be able to reach any learn or create activity within three clicks starting from the home menu.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Clearly differentiate the words of each companion from those of other companions, activity instructions, characters in a roleplay, and users.</strong> Each companion is a character in its own right and their speech bubbles should have unique identifiers. For example in one of our use cases, the companion named Rocki helps the user empathize with people in different scenarios. Rocki's speech bubbles are clearly marked in a different shade of purple from those of the characters.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>During a guided conversation, the user should not be presented with more than 4 options on the screen.</strong> If there are more than 4 options, have an icon that the user can click into to select from many options instead of crowding the screen.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>For any ratings on a known scale, use interactive sliders.</strong> You can adorn the sliders with emojis if they make sense within the context.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Blur the lines between the physical and virtusl world as much as possible. <strong>Let the user complete activities in the real world with the help of their companion.</strong> For example, one of our companions suggests cold water showers to help people with anixety relax and sets a timer while the user completes the activity.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                On the home screen, <strong>group the related activity types together in a box.</strong> For example in our companion Emily, we group baby's health and mom's health next to each other.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>In a guided conversation, it can be interesting to sometimes let the companion choose between different alternatives.</strong> Giving the same options to the companion and the user can make it a more balanced experience rather than giving all the power to guide the experience to the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               <strong>Develop a healthy cadence of interaction between the Hero and the user.</strong> Find out how often the user interacts with their companion during the first month and use that to determine how often to notify the user. Too little and you could lose user engagement, too often and you can annoy the user and desensitize them to your push notifications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Personalize your push notifications to the user.<strong> Use the previous interactions as input to generate unique push notifications for each user using GPT-3.</strong> For example, our motherhood Hero Emily generates custom notification to each mother depending on the results of their mastitis test.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the Hero use case involves any critical health, <strong> have a resources section with all the information needed for the user to get support.</strong> This can be clinics nearby, a crisis line, support group... This resource section should be easily accessible. You can even have a user action, shortcut
                            </li>

						    <p> Once you've onboarded the user and they've been acquainted with their Hero. <strong>Your goal is to get the companion to find out the user's motive, desires, and needs… and create empathetic experiences to help the user pursue their goals and grow.</strong> Use self-development as they key for empathy: We all want something and could use someone to help us step outside our comfort zone and achieve it. </p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Leveling</h2>
						<p>
                        Designing activities that are fun to complete with Hero the first time is easy. <strong>The design challenge is to create activities that can help the user and their companion grow together over time with repeated practice.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>You need to introduce a leveling system that allows the user and the companion new features or capabilities when they level up.</strong> Otherwise, if the activity engagement curve is flat, the user will get bored after a few completions and not want to repeat the same activity over and over again.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           For example, we had an activity where the user co-writes a story with their companion. There was no difference between the first story the user co-wrote and any subsequent story, other than the content of the story. To make this activity more engaging, we introduced a leveling system where the user gets new perks for their Hero. <strong>In the first level, the user can write a story with their AI companion. In the second level, the user can select a particular genre for their companion to write about. In the third, the companion can write in the style of a particular author that the user chooses...</strong> Unlocking these new features can help the user create more fine tuned writings and help the companion gain new writing skills.
                            </p>
                           
                        <p>
                        <strong>Depending on your use case, you define what it means to reach the next level.</strong> Does it happen when the user passes a certain amount of time interacting with their companion, learns about specific content, completes a certain number of creations...
                        </p>

                        <strong>You can even define a set of skills that the user must achieve to succeed. And then determine how completing each activity leads to the mastery of each skill.</strong> From there you can choose to level up each skill individually (e.g. listening level 2, empathy level 1) or grouping related skills into levels (e.g. level 1: goal-setting and knowing yourself, level 2: reflection and listening, level 3: empathy).

                        <strong>During onboarding, start softly with easier tasks to allow the user to gain comfort and to get a baseline of what the user is able to do on their own.</strong> You can then progressively ramp up the task difficulty until the user finds it challenging and add a feature to <strong>allow the companion to provide some help or suggestions.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        <strong>After onboarding, the goal of a companion is to help the user achieve things they couldn't alone.</strong> To maximize the benefits of this relationship, the activities should not be so easy such that the user does not need the companion to help them accomplish them but should not be too hard so that the user gives up. <strong>The difficulty of the activities should be in the zone of proximal development, a difficulty level where the user can complete the task with a nudge from their companion.</strong>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> Even though consistent progress is good, predictability is bad. <strong>Adding some variability in task difficulty can invoke surprise and lead to a more enjoyable leveling experience.</strong> Use “anticipation mingled with uncertainty” to invoke a sense of wonder. Hero's responses are also non-deterministic and depend on their mood state, which is influenced by the companion's experience and the current environment. This unpredictability adds to the surprise element and can make the relationship with the companion more interesting.</p>

							<h2 class="section-heading">Long term memory</h2>
						<p> <strong>Each Hero is equipped with a long term memory that is personalized to the user.</strong> The LTM holds the user's information and history of interactions  with the companion.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>You can enable Hero's behavior be guided by its memories.</strong>
                        If it is turned on during unguided chat, Hero will use semantic search to parse through the user’s input, search the companion’s memories for relevant information, and use the results to influence the companion’s next behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                       <strong>By default, Hero's long term memory mechanisms only chooses one memory to include as a behavioral input to GPT-3.</strong> You could improve it in many ways: aggregating the relevant memories, giving additional weight to more recent memories, giving more weight to more frequently brought up elements in the memories, giving similarity scores between the current conversational turn and the memories and weighting accordingly...
 </p>
 <p>
 <strong>You should also think about how you want the previously completed learn and create activities to influence future interactions with the companion. </strong>You can have the companion remember previous cocreations and use them to inform future cocreations or conversations.

                            <p><strong>
                            You should give the companion the ability to play a proactive role,</strong> so that it can add new elements to the conversations with the user rather than just reacting. You can give the companion interesting things to talk about in many ways.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            <strong>
                                Let the companion start with icebreakers and smalltalk. </strong> Keep the conversation topics light and fun at first, like when you're getting acquainted to someone new. Progressively go from shallow conversations to deeper ones where the companion tells the user about their story and listens to theirs.
                            </p>

                        <p><strong>You can give the companion the freedom to have its own life outside the interactions with the user.</strong> This can make the companion more interesting for the user. For example, the companion can complete activities on its own in its own time and show them to the user as part of the conversation (look what I did today). </p>
                        
                        <p><strong>You can also enable Hero to be aware of relevant factual knowledge about the world. </strong>Be sure to only use information relevant to the user and not politically biased. There are two options for doting Hero with relevant factual knowledge: in the free chat, you can make sure that Hero picks up on semantics about the user's location and interests. Or in the guided chat, Hero can ask the user where they are and what they like. The first option is more ideal but comes with more complexity around interpreting what the user talks about.</p>

                        <p> With generative networks and openAI's CLIP, AI is now capable of creating very advanced works of art. Most researchers designing AI artists are looking to optimize their AI to produce the finest art by copying the works of famous human master artists rather than starting from the very basics and discovering their artistic side with someone. If we follow this allknowing methodology, the user can just say "Hero, complete it" and the AI companion would use GPT3 to draw, write, create analogies etc. like an expert.
                         </p>
                         
                         <p>
                         <strong>In our view, the Hero companion shouldn't have all the drawing, writing, etc. skills immediately but should learn to hone their craft with the user.</strong> This process of self-discovery is crucial to (1) personalizing the kind of art the user and companion cocreate and (2) creating an engaging leveling experience where the companion artist unlocks new artistic skills.
                         </p>
                         
                         <p>For example, the companion can start as a tabula rasa and paints like a child, then as the user levels up the companion can learn to paint like an adult, then paint like a hobbyist, then like an amateur painter, then like a professional painter, then like a master.
